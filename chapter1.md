# x86 and x64

The x86 is little-endian architecture, x86 is the 32-bit implementation of the Intel architecture\(IA-32\) .It can operate in two modes: **real** and **protected**.

The 64-bit extension of the architecture is called x64 or x86-64. 

This chapter discusses the x86 architecture operating in protected mode. x86 supports the concept of privilege separation through an abstraction called ring level.
