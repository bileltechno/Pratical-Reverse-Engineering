# x86 and x64

The x86 is little-endian architecture, x86 is the 32-bit implementation of the Intel architecture\(IA-32\) .It can operate in two modes: **real** and **protected**.

The 64-bit extension of the architecture is called x64 or x86-64.

This chapter discusses the x86 architecture operating in protected mode. x86 supports the concept of privilege separation through an abstraction called ring level.

### Register Set and Data Types

When operating in protected mode, the x86 architecture has eight 32-bit general-purpose registers \(GPRs\): EAX , EBX , ECX , EDX , EDI , ESI , EBP , and ESP . The instruction pointer is stored in the EIP register.
